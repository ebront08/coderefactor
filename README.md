# <01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor>

## Hello world! This project is the first Homework assignment within the Coding Boot Camp at UNC for May 2021.
- First objective was to learn how to refactor existing code. 
- Second objective was to make sure that I understood the importance of refactoring existing code as this is an important task that many front end developers are given in the beginning. 
- Third objective is to make sure that the marketing agency that has hired me is satisifed and elated with my code refactoring.
